    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>During my time studying mathematics, there came a point where I 
      truly understood the term "PROOF". We proof mathematical statemets 
      as we define the language of mathematics to ourselves and to our 
      peers. This creates an insight to a universal rule that proofs are 
      factual because of conditions within our plane. Proofs are widely 
      accepted by many until proven wrong, so why not create the proof
      of my personal knowledge. If my knowledge is proven wrong, I only
      grow from it.</p>
    <p>Tools like GitHub have been around for sometime and understanding
      them has never been a challenge. But when you apply this knowledge
      to promote yourself? The challenge becomes "How do I present myself".
      You want to show all the flashy things and prove the indepth knowledge.
      You want to keep it simple, slick and sleek, but jam packed with years of
      trial and error. If your in the same boat as I, you also realize that 
      you'll have to refactor code, off your workstation and onto your
      personal device to avoid potential contract conflicts. </p>
    <p>In all, I want a way to present personal research and development in
      conjonction with a personalized toolbox of custom alogrithms, 
      monitoring tools, or configuration files I may need in my 
      careers lifetime. In turn, this will allow me to show Proof of work 
      and Proof of knowledge.</p>
    <p>I do hope you enjoy reading these potential solutions as I enjoyed making them.</p>
